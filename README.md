FFNeuralNet
===========

Neural net implementation in C++.

This is a project to learn about AI and neural network programming. I've so far implemented a non-batch vanilla backprop
algorithm which allows the neural network to be trained.

I've used the Eigen C++ linear algebra library to do the heavy lifting on the neural net weight matrix calculations.

Up next: try some applications more fun than XOR (!). Try better learning algorithms. Tidy up and optimise code.
Might also port to other platforms (linux and Windows?) as well as try porting to other languages if I'm still
finding this fun.
Also want to explore hidden markov models.
